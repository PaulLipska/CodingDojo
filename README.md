## Methods
- Data was cleaned and missing values were imputed
- Duplicate values were resolved 

## Results
- Two problem areas were Item_Weight and Outlet_Size.  For the first we chose to impute the median value and for the latter we replaced Nan values with "missing"
- The result of our first investigation shows a possible relation between weight of an item and its sales potential, see graph below.
